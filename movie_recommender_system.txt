Movie Recommender System

Overview: This Movie Recommender System suggests movies based on user preferences. It uses Python, Streamlit, pandas, pickle, and the TMDB API to recommend movies and display their posters.

Technologies Used:

Streamlit: For the interactive interface.
pandas: For data handling.
pickle: To load pre-trained movie data and similarity matrices.
requests: To fetch movie details and posters from the TMDB API.
How It Works:

Select a movie from the dropdown.
The system calculates the most similar movies using a pre-trained similarity matrix.
Recommended movie names and their posters are displayed.
